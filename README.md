# nim2-buildroot-toolchain

This project provides a Docker buildroot cross-compilation toolchain for building fully static musl executables for C/C++ and Nim. 

Static linking results in binaries that have all the necessary libraries bundled within, eliminating dependency issues, and runs on any Linux distribution.
